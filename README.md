Structure:
- The folder "multicontrol" contains the basic simulation classes.
- The folder "ag_with_estimated_model" contains the script files and results for the tuning and evaluation of controllers for the estimated model of a large size octacopter of around 3kg payload.
- The folder äg_with_merheb_model" contains the script files and results for the tuning and evaluation of controllers for the model of an octacopter based on the parameters presented on MERHEB, A.-R.; BATEMAN, F.; NOURA, H. Passive and active fault tolerant control of octorotor UAV using Second Order Sliding Mode control. In: 2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA). 2015. p. 1907–1912. ISBN 978-1-4799-7787-1.
